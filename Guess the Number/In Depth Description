                                                 Guess the Number Program
===============================================================================================================================

Overview:
In this game, a number from 1-20 is automatically generated by a list in the pick_number class. Then, that number is passed 
through to the function guess_nuumber. Here, the number is turned into a string and a prompt asks the user to guess the number.
The guess is added to a list of used numbers. Then an if statement compares the guess with the number to see if they are equal.
If so, the user wins. If not, the user continues to guess until it is right. 

Functions

Main: 
  All the main does is call to pick_number and then uses the return from pick_number for the parameter of guess_number.
  
pick_number:
  A list is created at the beginning of the fucntion then a number is randomly generated to be used as the index. After the 
  index is picked, the function will get the number at that index and return it.
 
guess_number(number):
  The chosen number is passed as number and transformed into a string. Then, a list is created to house numbers already guessed.
  The user is prompted to guess a number then that number is compared to the chosen number. If they are equal, the program will
  end. If not, the function will continue to run until the guess equals the chosen number.
