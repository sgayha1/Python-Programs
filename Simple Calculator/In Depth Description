                                                 Simple Calculator Program
===============================================================================================================================

Overview: This program operates as a calculator. The user will input two numbers then choose what operation they want to perform.
After that, the operation will be added to a list and will display on the screen. The user can either do more operations or stop
the program. At the end, the user can screenshot the list of operations.

main: 
  The main program code is inside a try except to make sure the input is correct, preventing a crash. First, the user inputs 
  two numbers they want to perform arithmetic on. Then, the user choses what operand they want. That number is passed into 
  "operation.get(num)" to get the corresponding number's operation in the dictionary, where the value calls to the specific 
  operand function. Then, the first number, operand, and the second number are added to another dictionary. The content of that
  are displayed on the screen then the user can continue to use the program until they are out of problems.
  
addition(first, second): 
  Adds the first and second number then returns the sum.

subtraction(first, second):
  Subtracts the first and second number then returns the difference.

multiplication(first, second):
  Multiplies the first and second number then returns the product.

division(first, second):
  Divides the first and second number then returns the result.

modulo(first, second):
  Gets the remainder of the first and second number then returns it.

display:
  Will display all operations/arithmetic performed throughout the program.
